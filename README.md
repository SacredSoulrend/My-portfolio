## User Story

I WANT to build a deployed portfolio of work samples as a web developer so that I can share my work and demonstrate whether or not I'm a strong contender for a position that is open.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:<br>

GIVEN I need to sample of my previous work<br>
WHEN I load my portfolio
THEN I am presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with my first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Credits

Smooth scroll functionality for the navigation links:<br>
I got this code from stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7717527/smooth-scrolling-when-clicking-an-anchor-link<br>

I got my reset css from here: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/#my-portfolio

Tutor(Faran Navazi) recommended I use "display: block" when changing the media screen.
